    """Saves a checkpoint with local-aware common state handling.

    This function mimics the CommonStrategy logic from Megatron's dist_checkpointing.save(),
    but with a key difference: it saves common data on each node (via local rank 0)
    rather than solely on the coordinator node (global rank 0).

    This is necessary for local checkpointing where each node needs its own copy
    of the common state for fast recovery.

    Args:
        checkpoint: The checkpoint dictionary to save.
        checkpoint_dir: The directory path to save the checkpoint to.
        save_strategy: The save strategy instance with async_save() and save() methods.
            Typically MLFlashpointMegatronAsyncSaveStrategy.
        async_save: Whether to save asynchronously. Defaults to True.

    Returns:
        An AsyncRequest if async_save is True and save succeeds, None otherwise.
        Returns None on save failure (exception is logged).
