        prefix: A string prefix to uniquely identify objects belonging to a

            and used in write_data to prepend to storage keys.

class MemoryStorageWriter(StorageWriter, staging.BlockingAsyncStager):
    """MemoryStorageWriter represents a local, in-memory StorageWriter implementation, with replication
    **to** peer node(s).

    It also implements BlockingAsyncStager, to customize staging behavior before write_data().

    This implementation prioritizes async writes, which can easily be made synchronous by blocking
    on the Futures returned by write_data().

    There are 2 ways to perform the stage + write steps using this Writer:
    1) The classic way - `stage() -> write_data()` - which will automatically replicate objects after write.
    2) The Megatron-async-friendly way: `prepare_write_data() -> stage_prepared_data() -> write_staged_write_buckets()`,
    where the output of `stage_prepared_data()` is the input to `write_staged_write_buckets()`, and you can
    control whether to replicate after write.

    Only one of these paths should be used, not both, along with the other APIs.

    Implementation notes:
     1. This class supports multiprocess sharing - specifically, it uses
     `torch.multiprocessing.Manager.dict()` for its internal write result state, so it can be used in spawned
     sub-processes, as Megatron and PyTorch DCP (optionally) do.

     2. Unlike Megatron's FileSystemWriterAsync, this StorageWriter can be reused across checkpoints (and hence tracks
     write state per checkpoint ID in case checkpointing overlaps across steps). This is mainly to facilitate using
     PyTorch DCP's pinned memory option for staging data.

     3. This class maintains a "current_checkpoint_id" attribute, that is used for abstract methods that expect
     this instance to know what checkpoint ID it is operating on. It is set via reset(), which is required to be called
     during checkpoint initialization for this purpose.
     However, where possible, it is recommended to provide the checkpoint_id explicitly. Since this instance is reused
     across multiple checkpoint IDs, which can overlap, explicitness avoids race conditions, especially for any
     operations done after the initial blocking phase (i.e. anything done async or after async operations).
